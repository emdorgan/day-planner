# Work Day Organizer

This project uses jQuery methods and bootstrap (3rd party APIs) to build an interactive scheduler for the user's typical work day (9am to 5pm). At the top of the page, today's date is displayed down to the second. Time blocks are color-coded depending on the current time of day, and the user has the option to enter in events and save them which persist based on local storage.

## To-do list

* Bootstrap the basic rows & columns for the day planner
* Make sure the boxes are input fields for the user
* Make functions for the boxes to change color based on time of day
* Add a save function that saves to local storage, and retrieve that event on page load
